ASSIGNMENT

Create a set of small stacking or nesting objects functional or otherwise.

(1) Use Rhino / Grasshopper to create an initial object. 

(2) Use Grasshopper to duplicate and transform the object so you have at least 5 stacked or nested copies.

(3) Ensure that the copies will effectively stack or nest by baking the copies and performing a boolean union.

(4) Ensure the design is 3D printable by checking edges and slicing in Cura.

(5) 3D print 3 of the designs on printer and test fit.

[OPTIONAL] Wrap 2D ornamental pattern on objects prior to printing them.
