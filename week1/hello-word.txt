ASSIGNMENT

(1) Design a 2D ornamental pattern in Grasshopper and extrude it into a 3 dimensional form.

- Nested grid

(2) Use Grasshopper and a Python code editor component to generate a 2D grid of points using two input points from Rhino.

(3) Using parameterized mathematical and logical inputs, modify the grid to produce a varying series of patterns, connected by lines.

- Nested patterns (changing mod)
- Use rtype for rotation of grid

(4) Using the grasshopper pufferfish extension and surface and extrude components, convert your lines into a 2.5D form.

(5) Bake the form and use a boolean operation to unify your form in Rhino. Ensure the design is 3D printable by checking its edges and slicing it in the Cura 3D software.

(6) Extend grid into 3 dimensions

- Based on distance to center raise / depress to create bowl like shape
